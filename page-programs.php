              <p>The first step in recovering from an addiction is to rid your body of drugs or alcohol. At our addiction detox center, The Right Place Detox offers a medically supervised detox to ensure that your recovery begins in a safe, effective way.</p>

              <p>The length of time it will take for you to completely detox will depend on the personal factors of your addiction. The substances in your body, how long you have been using them, and whether you have multiple addictions will all determine how long this phase of your treatment lasts. You should plan on at least a week or 10 days to fully complete your detox.</p>

              <p>During your stay at The Right Place Detox, you will be under continuous supervision. If your treatment team determines that medication would be helpful to ease your detox, we will provide it to you. You will also be offered the chance to begin individual or group therapy to help jump-start your transition into rehab.</p>

              <p>Another vital component of your addiction recovery program is nutrition. A healthy diet supports your body as it heals from a dependency on drugs or alcohol. Our dedicated cooks prepare tasty and nutritious meals that are designed with your recovery in mind.</p>

                    <h4>Treatment Options</h4>
                    <p>We offer medically-supervised detox for drug and alcohol addiction. Our treatment protocol also includes psychological counseling. You can choose to participate in a program that is designed specifically for men or women.</p>
                    <p>In Florida, you cannot enter an alcohol rehab program unless your body has been completely rid of alcohol. Trying to detox alone can be very dangerous, though, and that is why we are here. Our alcohol addiction detox takes into account the fact that alcohol withdrawal can be dangerous. At our facility, you will be under the care of medical professionals, and most patients will receive medications to ease the worst withdrawal symptoms.
